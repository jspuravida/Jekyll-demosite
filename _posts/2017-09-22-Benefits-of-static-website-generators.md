Some of the benefits of a static website generator are that they are:

- **Simple** - makes building and maintaining websites incredibly simple. Static sites are easier to maintain (no databases, no server-side scripts!). Use static website generators when you're after simplicity and want to put the emphasis on the content, which is waht you should be doing. It doesn't really matter whether you're focusing on hosting a huge website, or a simple portfolio, static websites can be extremely useful when it comes to saving money, time, and resources.

- **Fast** - Static files can be served fast. There is no database or templating layer that slows requests down. Additionally, web servers will automatically set caching headers (such as Last-Modified) for static files, which reduce bandwidth usage.

- **Secure** - As they do not contain dynamic content, so they are immune to the most common attacks. Considering the only thing being served to users' devices are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

- **Have versioning** - Storing ontent in flat text files makes them ideal to be used with version control systems such as Git.
- Utilizing a static site generator means you can build websites with **modern frameworks and workflows**, with a high degree of productivity and efficiency.

- Uses **markdown**

- **Previewable**: Because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with the site to your hearts content without affecting the live site.
